Gamebit
===========

Gamebit was an iOS app I made that showed the current and upcoming releases, downloads, and events happening in video games. It never really took off, but I thought I'd post the code anyway. It was made with Xamarin in C#. Just about everything except the components I used should be in here - including all the assets.
